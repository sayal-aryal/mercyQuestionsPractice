//Define an array to be n-primeable if for a given n, all elements of the array when incremented by n are prime. Recall that a prime 
//number is a number that has no factors except 1 and itself. Write a method named isNPrimeable that has an array parameter and an 
//integer parameter that defines n; the method returns 1 if its array parameter is n-primeable; otherwise it returns 0.
//If you are programming in Java or C#, the function signature is
//int isNPrimeable(int[ ] a, int n)
//If you are programming in C or C++, the function signature is
//int isNPrimeable(int a[ ], int len, int n) where len is the number of elements in the array a. 
//Examples
//If a is and n is then function
//returns reason 
//{5, 15, 27} 2 1 5+2=7 is prime, and 15+2=17 is prime, and 27+2=29 is prime
//{5, 15, 27} 3 0 5+3=8 is not prime
//{5, 15, 26} 2 0 26+2=28 is not prime
//{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} 4 1 1+4=5 is prime. This obviously holds for all elements in the array
//{} 2 1
//Since there are no elements in the array, there cannot exist one that is 
//non-prime when 2 is added to it.
